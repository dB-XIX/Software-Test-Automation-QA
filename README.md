How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

You can ensure your code is functional and secure by performing testing early and often during development, including both functional and non-functional tests. Utilization of different levels of testing from unit testing to integration, system, and performance testing are also key.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

This is achieved by referring to a requirements document prepared by interviewing the client or potential users. Once this information is gathered it can be formed into user stories and detailed requirements that can be broken down into sprints, if using an Agile approach.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first determining the user's needs and expectations. These can then be broken down into sprints for development. Testing should be performed early and often at all levels while cautiously and consciously considering bias and complacency with a disciplined attitude. Once I have verified that all requirements have been met and testing coverage is at an acceptable level, the software can be released and a maintenance program implented.
